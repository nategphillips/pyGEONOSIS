# NOTE: 25/03/27 - The use of Matplotlib is retained here since PyQtGraph's default color maps
#       aren't as useful as those from Matplotlib. Furthermore, PyQtGraph can use color maps from
#       Matplotlib, but it still requires Matplotlib to be installed in the local environment, so
#       the maps from Matplotlib are just used directly instead.
